# Firewall Rules Optimization using IPTables

## About
This project analyzes and optimizes firewall rules for Linux IPTables, focusing on packet filtering to improve security, performance, and manageability.

---

## Introduction
Firewalls are critical network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. They serve as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet, blocking malicious traffic and unauthorized access.

In this project, we use Linuxâ€™s `iptables` to demonstrate the functioning of firewall rules, focusing on:

- **Packet Filtering:** Checks packet headers and applies rules.
- **Proxy Service & Stateful Inspection:** (Conceptual overview for context.)

We also tackle common firewall anomalies through rule optimization:

- **Shadowing**  
- **Generalization**  
- **Redundancy**

---

## Objectives
- Parse and analyze existing IPTables firewall rules.
- Detect and resolve:
  - Shadowing anomalies (hidden rules).
  - Generalization anomalies (overlapping rules).
  - Redundancy anomalies (unnecessary rules).
- Reorder and optimize rules to improve firewall performance and maintain intended security policy.
